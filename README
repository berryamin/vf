This is a collection of QNX4 virtual filesystems, and a framework
to implement them. It's a hobby and experiment of mine, and I'd be
interested in any comments or feedback.

See the notes at http://sam-github.github.com/vf

To build, do a 'make build'. Each sub-directory contains one of the vfs'.

To install, do a 'make install'.

If this doesn't work for you, the makefiles are quite simple,
and please e-mail me about any problems you have!
