This is a collection of QNX4 virtual filesystems, and of a framework
to implement them. It's a hobby and experiment of mine, and I'd be
interested in any comments or feedback.

See the note in vf.txt, or vf.html.

To build, type make in the "vf" directory. This will make
vf.lib and vf_ram.

The cd into "tarfs" and type make. This will make vf_tar
and tart (the tar archive class tester).

If this doesn't work for you, the makefiles are quite simple,
and please e-mail me about any problems you have:
