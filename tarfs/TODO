* Implement heuristics for eliding the top directory.

* Implement heuristics for adjusting locations of symbolic links.

* By presenting uid/gid as in the tar file we create security hole...
	what if somebody tars up /bin/sh and modifies the tar file to say
	its suid/sgid?

	fix 1) don't allow execution (I currently don't, but could make it
		an option).
	fix 2) present all files as owned by the caller..

	I guess the second is the only secure way... though I like the
	ability to present the files in the archive with "correct"
	ownership and permissions.

	x DONE - I've made all files appear to be owned by the owner.
