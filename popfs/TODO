* use top to get from/subject, and respond to readlink with this info?

* permissions checks are important here, but still missing from framework

* vf_pop can't getpass() if you start it in background, so detect that,
  and have it become a daemon by default (unless -d specified) but only
  after collecting a valid password.

* implement rm() - this is hard because POP3 doesn't allow messages
  be uniquely identified... and when you delete one the number identifying
  all the others changes (in an implementation dependent way)

* see if I can do cool things with relay to make reads go directly to Fsys...

* implement QUIT when root of vfsys is rmdired.
 -> DONE (actually, don't need since we now QUIT after every transaction)

* cache in fstream, not strstream!
 -> DONE
