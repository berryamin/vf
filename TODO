* The ocb map could store a pointer to a OcbMapNode object that had the
reference counting stuff in it, leaving the Ocb pure abstract. this makes
sense, since the ocb doesn't need this info.

* support hard links? either way I need a link count in entities to support
the Unixy removing of an entity leaving any open fds to that entity valid
till they're closed

* The methods are returning 0 for "unsupported by this ocb", which will
trigger an assert, I think... I think I need to provide defaults for the
dir/file specific methods (but not for generic ones like fstat()) that
correctly return ENOTDIR, or whatever is appropriate.

* QNX Fsys directories support read... and maybe write? Should I?

* write an app that tests the file system...

* make request pointers to Ocb functions "const" and reorganize ocb functios
into generic/file specific/dir specific.

* does open honor O_EXCL if O_CREAT is requested?
