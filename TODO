* The ocb map could store a pointer to a OcbMapNode object that had the
reference counting stuff in it, leaving the Ocb pure abstract. this makes
sense, since the ocb doesn't need this info.

* Support hard links? either way I need a link count in entities to support
removing of an entity with open fds to that entity.

* Some methods are returning 0 for "unsupported by this ocb", which will
trigger an assert, I think I need to provide defaults for the
dir/file specific methods (but not for generic ones like fstat()) that
correctly return ENOTDIR, or whatever is appropriate.

* QNX Fsys directories support read and write. Should I? Why?

* Write an app that tests the file system...

* Make request pointers to Ocb functions "const" and reorganize ocb functios
into generic/file specific/dir specific.

* Does open honor O_EXCL if O_CREAT is requested?

* How extensible is it? Implement VFsys_tar.
